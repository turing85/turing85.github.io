This is Pen² (spoken: "Pen Pen", original: "ペンペン"). He is a new species of penguin, created through genetic experimentation (link:https://wiki.evageeks.org/Pen_Pen[`wiki.evageeks.org`, window=_blank]). He is a minor character in the anime Neon Genesis Evangelinon (original: "新世紀エヴァンゲリオン"). I used him as avatar for quite some time now. In fact, it is so long that I cannot say exactly why I chose him. Maybe I chose him due to the influence the anime had on me as an adolescent. Maybe it is a subconscious nod to https://www.gentoo.org/["Gentoo (`gentoo.org`)", window=_blank], the first linux distribution I used. In short: I cannot remember and say for sure.
